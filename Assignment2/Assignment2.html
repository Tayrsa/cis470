                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>
                    Hello all, my name is Taylor Sain, a Mathematics Major,
                    Computer Science Major at Spelman College. I come from the
                    Volunteer State and homey green fields of Tennessee. While
                    at Spelman, I've had the gracious opportunity to become a
                    member of the Exceptional Epsilon Eta Chapter of Sigma
                    Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc where I've been able to positively
                    impact the campus and community around us. Along with these
                    efforts, I've also been able to serve as a Worship Leader in
                    Manifest Praise Team of Sister's Chapel. I am honored to have
                    also participated in various education internships through
                    Spelman professors and the opportunity of assisting students
                    with math courses in the Math Lab on campus.

                <h2>Why Math and Computers at Spelman?</h2>
                <p> I know you all are wondering... What in the world was
                she thinking? Mathematics as a major and Computer Science
                as a minor to follow up. I know. I wouldn't have approved
                at all. Interesting enough, I started out as a Biology major;
                I thought I'd make the most money and save the world at the
                same time. You know, kill two birds with one stone I guess.
                I quickly found out that this major was not for me. Ironically,
                I was taking a <b>"hard"</b> math class but I was acing
                each test! That was enough motivation for me, so I switched over.
                Now we know parents do not typically approve of abrupt changes
                so I also wrote my dad a letter explaining how my life could
                still make sense with this change and of course I listed all
                of the highest paying jobs along with it. As for Computer Science,
                Dr. Marshall, the current chair of the department, kind of convinced
                me, so I went along with it and now I'm here and I've learned so much!</p>
