                Technology has a lot to do with why things keep creeping
                up in price. More cars, gas goes up. More technology, more
                special effects, movie prices go up! Well, now animation
                is such a big part of our world and it has prompted new technology to be used
                such like that of 3D printing. Pixar actually used 3D printing in
                their latest movie, <i>Toy story 3.</i> Watch the video to find out more.

                Guess who's favorite banking company is partnering up with a group in China!
                IBM and a unit of China's Dalian Wanda Group which happens to be a property and
                entertainment conglomerate will be pairing up to provide China companies cloud
                computing. Cloud computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers
                hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local
                server or a personal computer. The duo will be responsible for distributing, building
                and operating the IBM cloud platform in China.

                Uber has taken it upon themselves to venture out into the artifical world
                of technology and inteligence by attempting to incorporate Anthony Levandowski's
                self-driving concept into their own business. However, in defiance of California
                State Law, where an incident of a self driving uber ran a red light in San Fransico,
                they've earned themselves a lawsuit. The traffic violation proves Uber's agression towards
                moving forward with technology with the ambition of their current project leader Levandowski.
                As the lawsuit from Waymo manifests, it is easy to peek a view into the high stakes world
                of technology.

                If pleasing customers hasn't been hard enough already, imagine
                creating a product and the user is unpleased. Finished product and all,
                but now you must rework your masterpiece to meet user requirements. Facebook
                is a prime example of a company who is successful but still battles with
                performing acts derived from the user's requirements. Ever noticed why you may
                leave the website of Facebook within the first 3 seconds? It is because it took
                too long for you to load. However, Facebook's solution isn't to rework it's
                own business principles and product as a whole but to force advertisement to
                speed up its loading principles. Other companies have taken the less "complicated"
                way out of fixing problems. Advertisement and digital services in general make great
                templates for evaluating a businesses effectiveness and prove that user experience
                should be applied first or during the development process.

            <h3>What Small Businesses Don't Get about Big Data</h3><hr/>
            <p>
                <i>Mar. 17, 2017</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Big Data is a phrase used to mean a massive volume of both structured and
                unstructured data that is so large it is difficult to process using traditional
                database and software techniques. In most enterprise scenarios the volume of
                data is too big or it moves too fast or it exceeds current processing capacity.
                Most small businesses think human touch outweighs anything automated but tends to
                potentially inhibit success at the expense of data collection. Others believe that
                revenue will not be enhanced due to data. Using data can increase profit and saves
                time in the long run. Then you have those that believe data should immediately solve
                problems. Slow down and <em>recoup!</em> With the use of data, small businesses can
                make stronger decisions on future business strategies. Data being too broad and collecting
                data can become expensive, serve as further misconceptions of small businesses. But, those
                worries are much too little compared to what can be gained from collecting data.
